# avr-gcc-scons
## Bare Metal Arduino Building with Scons


This repository aims to create a very clear and easy way to build your Arduino projects (and flash it - see the ```task.json``` command examples), with the possibility to control up to the very last building flag.

If you - as me - have got yourself lost from the plug and play philosophy which hides all the building details (the verbose flag is not even the default one) and you need a way to get the control back, well, this repository could be the answer.

## Installation

```sh
$ cd avr-gcc-scons
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building the project

```sh
$ cd avr-gcc-scons
$ scons -j4
```

## Flashing a program
the examples reported are in Windows, but the steps to adjust them to other OS should be easy

### with Command Line

Arduino UNO
```sh
$ <path_to_avrdude>bin/avrdude -C<path_to_avrdude>etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P<your_COM> -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:<path_to_avr_gcc_scons>\\build\\appl\\uno\\helloworld\\helloworld.hex:i
```

Arduino NANO Every
```sh
$ mode <your_COM> baud=12 dtr=on > nul && mode <your_COM> baud=12 dtr=off > nul && <path_to_avrdude>bin/avrdude -C<path_to_avrdude>etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega4809 -cjtag2updi -P<your_COM> -b115200 -e -D -Uflash:w:<path_to_avr_gcc_scons>\\build\\appl\\nanoevery\\blink\\blink.hex:i -Ufuse2:w:0x01:m -Ufuse5:w:0xC9:m -Ufuse8:w:0x00:m {upload.extra_files}
```
> *NOTE*: mode ```<your_COM>``` baud=12 dtr=on > nul && mode ```<your_COM>``` baud=12 dtr=off > nul is used to reset the COM port in order to make Arduino Nano Every to stay in the Bootloader so to receive the commands from ```avrdude```

### with VSCODE
Under the hood we call ```avrdude``` with the poper parametrs (be free to experiment with that), see the full command inside ```task.json```
```sh
1. Open avr-gcc-scon folder whit VSCODE
2. Type CTRL + SHIFT + B to open the building tasks defined in 'task.json'
3. Select one of 'flash (nano every)' or 'flash (uno)'
```

## avr-gcc-scons

This generation tool uses [Scons](https://www.scons.org) to generates all the steps useful to build from a simple Arduino sketch to an extended professional project.  Scons is  a very powerful, yet easy, construction tool, fully relaying on Python as configuration language. This means: what Scons does along the building just comes up easily to you from the code (a Python line).

I provide a Scons tool for the ```avr-gcc``` toolchain, and example of project compilation for Arduino Uno, and Arduino Nano Every. For each board there is a bare metal example ```helloworld``` where Arduino core library is not used, next to the classical sketch ```blink``` used by Arduino IDE.

So there are mainly two ways to use this repository:
1) ***Curiosity level***: clone the repository, modify, add or adjust the code in one of the folder, lunch ```scons``` command, and you have the executable ready to be flashed in the MCU memory, same smooth and peaceful experience of a plug and play tool

2) ***Expert level***: experiment with the flag (have you ever wonder how much size code LTO can save? And the -Os flag? Why don't compile for speed with -Of?), read the .map file (a photo of you executable in human readable format), optimize in deep your code.

## Philosophy
> I chosen to copy the code from the Arduino core library and provide it in the lib/ folder for one main reason: when the code of the core is update by ```Arduino IDE```, you want your well tested and long used executable not to be affected by this. If one want to try the last core release can always delete the content lib/arduino and replace the existing files with the last ones (a cleaner way should be add another folder lib/arduino<put_version_number_here>, copy ```Sconscript``` from lib/arduino, adjust it and use that on your program)

## New Boards

Well, until the board uses the avr core in lib/arduino or the avrmega core in lib/arduinomega there is nothing to worry about. The only thing to do is pass to the project the correct variants/<foldername> folder
```sh
def build_program(env):
    env.IncludeLibrary('arduinomega',arduino_variants_dir='nona4809')
```
To find out what variants/<foldername> folder is used, we can see how is compiled `variant.c` by ```Arduino IDE``` (with verbose option enabled) or by Vscode with Arduino extension (arduino.loglevel="verbose" on settings.json)

## Contributing

Eventually, whoever wants to improve and contribute to the extension of this tool is welcome.

>That's all folks, happy building!

## Dependencies

Python 3 (or 2) is required (Scons works even with Python 2, but who we are to not use Python 3 in a 2022 Project), installed by one of the following
* [Anaconda] - Anaconda Individual Edition is the worldâ€™s most popular Python distribution platform
* [Python3.x] - Python 3.x (a.k.a. "Python 3000" or "Py3k") is a new version of the language that is incompatible with the 2.x line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed. Also, the standard library has been reorganized in a few prominent places
